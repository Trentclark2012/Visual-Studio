      <h1 id="swoth1"><u>SWOT Analysis</u></h1>
		  <h4 id="HistoryBullets">Strenghts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The structure of the Basic programming language is very simple, particularly as to the executable code.
		<li><b>VB is not only a language but primarily an integrated, interactive development environment (“IDE“).</li>
		<li><b>The VB-IDE has been highly optimized to support rapid application development (“RAD”). It is particularly easy to develop graphical user interfaces and to connect them to handler functions provided by the application.</li>
		<li><b>The graphical user interface of the VB-IDE provides intuitively appealing views for the management of the program structure in the large and the various types of entities (classes, modules, procedures, forms, …).</li>
		<li><b>VB provides a comprehensive interactive and context-sensitive online help system.</li>
		<li><b>When editing program texts the “IntelliSense” technology informs you in a little popup window about the types of constructs that may be entered at the current cursor location.</li>
		<li><b>VB is a component integration language which is attuned to Microsoft’s Component Object Model (“COM”).</li>
		<li><b>COM components can be written in different languages and then inegrated using VB.</li>
		<li><b>Interfaces of COM components can be easily called remotely via Distributed COM (“DCOM”), which makes it easy to construct distributed applications.</li>
		<li><b>COM components can be embedded in / linked to your application’s user interface and also in/to stored documents (Object Linking and Embedding “OLE”, “Compound Documents”).</li>
		<li><b>There is a wealth of readily available COM components for many different purposes.</li>
		<li><b>Visual Basic is built around the .NET environment used by all Microsoft Visual languages, so there is very little that can’t be done in Visual Basic that can be done in other languages (such as C#).</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="main_section col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 offset-lg-2">
      <h4 id="HistoryBullets">Weaknesses</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Constant upgrades</b> – Microsoft is not perfect. So, while it’s mostly a good thing to have new features, it can also be a problem as new bugs can be introduced that may hinder the development. However, this is offset by the reputation that Microsoft has to uphold. Imagine what would happen if all the organizations on VSO would be unable to do their work? That’s right</li>
       <li><b>Visual basic is a proprietary programming language written by Microsoft, so programs written in Visual basic cannot, easily, be transferred to other operating systems.</li>
		<li><b>There are some, fairly minor disadvantages compared with C. C has better declaration of arrays – its possible to initialise an array of structures in C at declaration time; this is impossible in VB.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </div>
    <div class="main_section col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 offset-lg-2">
      <h4 id="HistoryBullets">Opportunities</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Faster Development Cycle</b> –Because it integrates directly into the tools we use daily (Visual Studio & Azure), it means that team productivity should improve. It means less jumping through hoops to make certain things happen (e.g. linking check-ins with Work items, or rather, seeing changes introduced by one work item). We used Jira before, and we had an internal policy of writing the changeset number into the comment… </li>
        <li><b>Quicker Identification of build errors</b> –Setting up a CI build with the on-prem TFS we used thus far was a bit complicated because the version was outdated. That meant automatic deploys to Azure environments were impossible (in terms of effort required vs. gain). VSO is fully integrated with Azure in this department, and additionally, it allows connecting an on premise build controller. </li>
        <li><b>Improve the release management process</b> – It also allows connecting to tools like Release Management, and Microsoft Test Manager, which means our existing processes can be vastly improved and sped up. </li>
        <li><b>More flexibility for developers<b> -This move by Microsoft also changes the entire ecosystem of developing, including for those who rely on the .NET platform. Developers are no longer forced into the narrow boundaries of a particular or singular runtime setting.</li>
        <li><b>New coding opportunities<b> -Visual Studio is a very popular IDE. According to a blog post from Microsoft, it has over 7 million 2013 version downloads, and .NET has been installed more than a billion times. By turning to open source, the IDE offers developer tools that cover every developer, across all platforms.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="main_section col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 offset-lg-2">
      
      <h4 id="HistoryBullets">Threats</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>No code backups</b> –technically, you can’t migrate back to on-premise servers without loosing your revision history. However, Microsoft has already mentioned a potential solution for this on their blog. It might not be publicly available, but from what we understood, there is some support available for this migration. In any case, code backups can be mitigated by regularly creating “drops”. It’s not ideal, but can help solve some part of the problem. </li>
        <li><b>Moving code to non-company-owned servers</b> – This is a big one. Having code located outside the company can be perceived as a threat. However, code ownership and all legal rights are explicitly retained by the author/owner of the code and no ownership is implied by Microsoft in the legal agreements. Additionally, Microsoft is ISO 27001 certified. The ISO 27000 family of standards helps organizations keep information assets secure. Also, in terms of security and backups, we are confident that Microsoft has, compared to our team, an almost infinite number of resources at their disposal that make sure VSO is protected from things like DDOS attacks, hacks, etc. Our code should be as safe, if not safer. Keep in mind though, the major threat to code theft, are still humans. This is solved using legal tactics, not technical measures. </li>
